# Hangman
My first writing in Python, a hangman game

My first writing in Python
I used here some functions I created
To play you need to insert a word file as input (for convenience I have added a word file here in the database, but you can play with any Word file)
I would be very happy for a review and comments
See this as my first plan
My knowledge of Python is still basic
Thanks

Input 1: Path to word file
Input 2: Number (selects a word from the file based on the number)
Output: After the course of the game - success / failure
